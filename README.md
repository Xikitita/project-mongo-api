# Project Mongo API

This project had been about creating routes and seeding a database.

## The problem

I started with following the codealongs provided by Technigo. Finding inspiration from codealongs and from others' code, I managed to figure out how to create my routes and it wasn't the easiest thing to find a way to filter the data (a json file consisting of hundreds of books) to get only one author represented, for example. I spent a decent amount of time and had to do a lot of research, til' I fianlly found a solution in one of my classmates code, that I could implement in mine. So grateful for that!

If I had time, I would make more routes and dig deeper into how to save sensitive data and prevent it from leaking out, which was one of this weeks topics.
